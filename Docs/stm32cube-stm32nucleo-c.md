# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect STM32 Nucleo based sensor node to the Microsoft Azure IoT Hub, by leveraging on Azure IoT Device SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering STM32 Nucleo to Azure IoT Hub
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on STM32 Nucleo
 

<a name="Prerequisites"></a>
# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process.

## 1.1 Development environment
- One among these three IDEs installed in your PC: [Keil MDK-ARM][lnk-ide-keil], [IAR Embedded Workbench][lnk-ide-iar], [AC6 System Workbench for STM32][lnk-ide-sw4stm32]
- A serial terminal installed in your PC (e.g. [TeraTerm][lnk-teraterm]) 
- [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
- [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]

#### NOTE
[SystemWorkbench for STM32][lnk-ide-sw4stm32] is the free integrated development environment for STM32, and it is used as reference in this guide.

## 1.2 Hardware components
 - STM32 Nucleo development board ([NUCLEO-F401RE][lnk-nucleo-f4])
 - Wi-Fi expansion board for STM32 Nucleo ([X-NUCLEO-IDW01M1][lnk-nucleo-wifi])
 - Motion MEMS and environmental sensor expansion board for STM32 Nucleo ([X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1][lnk-nucleo-sensors] or [X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2][lnk-nucleo-sensors2]).
 - Dynamic NFC tag expansion board for STM32 Nucleo (optional, [X-NUCLEO-NFC01A1][lnk-nucleo-nfc]) 
 - When the X-NUCLEO-NFC01A1 board is mounted, an NFC enabled Android phone is necessary to set SSID and Password of WiFi access point with a mobile application.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device
Combine STM32 Nucleo with its expansion boards as shown in the figure below:

## 3.1 Build SDK and sample code

1. Download [FP-CLD-AZURE1 Function Pack][lnk-nucleo-fp]. The Function Pack contains all the required drivers to use the STM32 Nucleo board with Wi-Fi, Sensors and NFC expansion boards, together with pre-integrated Microsoft Azure IoT SDK. 
2. Unzip the package and open one of the pre-configured project files available in ```AZURE1_F4_V2.0.0/Projects/Multi/Applications/HTTPS_Azure```, according to the IDE installed (for [SystemWorkbench for STM32][lnk-ide-sw4stm32] project files are inside folder ```SW4STM32```). In [SystemWorkbench for STM32][lnk-ide-sw4stm32] select the project from menu ```File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace```; browse folders and select as root directory ```AZURE1_F4_V2.0.0/Projects/Multi/Applications/HTTPS_Azure/SW4STM32/STM32F401RE-Nucleo```.
3. Open  file ```AzureIOTSDKConfig.h``` (inside folder ```AZURE1_F4_V2.0.0/Projects/Multi/Applications/HTTPS_Azure/Inc```) and update ```AZUREIOTHUBCONNECTIONSTRING``` with the credentials retrieved after having registered the device in IoT Hub as described in [Step 1.1][lnk-setup-iot-hub].
4. Build the project according to the selected IDE. In [SystemWorkbench for STM32][lnk-ide-sw4stm32], select the Build configuration with ```Project -> Build Configurations -> Set Active``` based on the sensors expansion board mounted; then select ```Project -> Build All``` (or shortcut ```Ctrl+B```).

5. Flash the binary to Nucleo board according to the selected IDE. In [SystemWorkbench for STM32][lnk-ide-sw4stm32] select ```Run -> Run Configurations```; click on ```New launch configuration``` and select available configuration (X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 or X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2); then in text box ```C/C++ Applications``` type in X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1\STM32F4xx-Nucleo.elf or X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2\STM32F4xx-Nucleo.elf depending on the configuration built; then click on Apply and Run.

## 3.2 Connect STM32 Nucleo board to a WiFi access point 

Configure your serial terminal with the following parameters to visualize log messages from Nucleo board:
- BaudRate : 460800
- Data : 8 bit
- Parity : none
- Stop : 1 bit 
- Flow Control : none

In order to set or to overwrite WiFi access point parameters (SSID and Password), keep pressed USER button in STM32 Nucleo after RESET. If NFC board is mounted and if SSID and Password were previously written to NFC with the mobile application, these will be read and used to connect with the Access Point. In order to copy parameters to NFC board, an Android mobile phone equipped with an NFC WriteTag application need to be used (i.e. you can install and use [ST25 application][lnk-android-st25] ). 
Alternatively WiFi parameters can be configured via serial terminal, or directly set in source code by replacing ```X_CLOUD_SSID```, ```X_CLOUD_KEY``` in file ```AzureIOTSDKConfig.h```.
After first time WiFi parameters are set, these are permanently written to FLASH memory and used each time the board is RESET, unless USER button is kept pressed.

## 3.3 Send Device Events to IoT Hub:

After having established the connection with Azure IoT Hub, the application starts to transmit sample data read from sensor board (motion MEMS, temperature, pressure, humidity) using HTTPS protocol. If neither X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 or X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 are mounted, the application will transmit dummy data to IoTHub.

See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the ```simplesample_http``` application running in STM32 Nucleo.

Messages sent to Azure IoT are also printed in serial terminal interface. 


## 3.3 Receive messages from IoT Hub

See [Manage IoT Hub][lnk-manage-iot-hub] to learn how to send cloud-to-device messages to the application.
Messages received by STM32 Nucleo are printed over serial terminal interface once received. 
Some cloud-to-device messages are a interpreted by the embedded application: 
- quit : quit application 
- reset : reset board
- led on : LED2 onboard Nucleo on
- led off : LED2 off
- delay <seconds> : change samples frequency 

A QuickStart guide to setup and run the application can also be downloaded [here][lnk-quickstart-st].
